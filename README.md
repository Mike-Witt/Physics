Functions to calculate the main GR tensors, given a metric tensor in
symbolic form. Used by the <code>Curvature_2d.ipynb</code> notebook.

Given the metric tensor in symbolic form, calculate other objects of
interest. Probably the only interesting case here is the two dimensional
spherical surface.
